# HotDoc Caller ID - Threat Modelling

# What have we built?

The Caller ID feature allows users at our practices to see, on their HotDoc sidebar, the phone number that is currently calling the practice. If this number matches a patient in their database, it also shows details of the patient, upcoming appointments, and has quick shortcuts for common actions, like rescheduling an appointment or creating a new one.

See README.md for more!

# Attack vectors

TODO: Copy all sections below for each threat you can think of

## Threat 1 (for example, Privilege Escalation)

What is it?:
TODO: A short paragraph explaining what the threat is, aiming to give context of what you’re worried about, as well as share knowledge on things that’ve hurt in the past

## Assumptions:

TODO: a list of things you believe to be true related to the threat and/or prevention

- First assumption
- Second assumption
  ...

## Mitigations:

TODO: a list of concrete measures in place that help to reduce the impact or likelihood of the threat

- First mitigation
- Second mitigation
  ...

## Questions:

TODO: a list of questions that remain unanswered about the threat/assumptions/mitigations

- First question
- Second question
  ...

## Risk:

TODO: a short paragraph detailing your assessment of the impact “how bad it’d be if the threat eventuated”  and the likelihood “how likely it is the threat will be exploited” of the threat, and with that in mind, an assessment of the risk posed given the threat/assumptions/mitigations

## Threat 2 (for example, Privilege Escalation)

What is it?:
TODO: Another short paragraph explaining what the second threat is, aiming to give context of what you’re worried about, as well as share knowledge on things that’ve hurt in the past
